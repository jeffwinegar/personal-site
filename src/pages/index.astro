      <h1>Hey, I'm Jeff Winegar.</h1>

      <p>
        I'm a full stack JavaScript developer focused on front-end technologies
        based out of Los Angeles. Originally a graphic designer for 10 years, I
        transitioned into web development and have been building websites for
        the past {yrsExp} years. When not writing code I am also an <a

          >avid bike commuter</a
        >; a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jeff_winegar/">photographer</a>;
        and a maker. I also really enjoy <a
          href="https://music.apple.com/profile/jeff_winegar">music</a
        > and watching a good <a href="https://letterboxd.com/jeff_winegar/"
          >movie</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Though always exploring new
        technologies, my focus right now is on Typescript, React.js, Node,
        Serverless, Edge Computing, Astro, and Next.js. Take a look at a few of
        my public projects:

        I am currently a Senior Web Developer at Wunderman Thompson where I do
        hands-on development and lead teams working for clients including
        Genesis, Hyundai, Mazda, Shell, Snap, and Synchrony Bank in projects
        that span from micro-sites, landing pages, and site components to
        responsive dynamic data-driven emails and animated banner ads.
