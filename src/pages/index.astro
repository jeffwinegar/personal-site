    <h1>Hey, I'm Jeff Winegar.</h1>

    <p>
      I'm a full stack JavaScript developer focused on front-end technologies
      based out of Los Angeles. Originally a graphic designer for 10 years, I
      transitioned into web development and have been building websites for the
      past {yrsExp} years. When not writing code I am also an <a

        >avid bike commuter</a
      >; a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jeff_winegar/">photographer</a>;
      and a maker. I also really enjoy <a
        href="https://music.apple.com/profile/jeff_winegar">music</a
      > and watching a good <a href="https://letterboxd.com/jeff_winegar/"
        >movie</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      I work in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Though always exploring new
      technologies, my focus right now is on Typescript, React.js, Node,
      Serverless, Astro, and Next.js. Take a look at a few of my public
      projects:

      I am currently a Senior Web Developer at Wunderman Thompson where I do
      hands-on development and lead teams working for clients including Genesis,
      Hyundai, Mazda, Shell, Snap, and Synchrony Bank in projects that span from
      micro-sites, landing pages, and site components to responsive dynamic
      data-driven emails and animated banner ads.
