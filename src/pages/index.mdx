# Hey, I'm Jeff Winegar.

<p>I'm a Frontend JavaScript Developer based out of Los Angeles. Originally a graphic designer for 10 years, I transitioned into web development and have been building websites for the past {yrsExp} years. When not writing code I am also an <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/1123257">avid bike commuter</a>; a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jeff_winegar/">photographer</a>; and a maker. I also really enjoy music and <a href="https://letterboxd.com/jeff_winegar/films/">movies</a>.</p>

I work in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Though always exploring new technologies, my focus right now is on React.js, Gatsby, GraphQL, Node, and Express. Take a look at a few of my public projects:

I am currently a Senior Web Developer at Wunderman Thompson where I do hands-on development and lead teams working for clients including Hyundai, Genesis, Shell, Pennzoil, Quaker State, Hulu, CareCredit, SCAN, and The University of California, Irvine in projects that span from micro-sites, landing pages, and site components to responsive dynamic data-driven emails and animated banner ads.
