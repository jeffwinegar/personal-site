<p>Hey there. I'm Jeff Winegar, a Frontend JavaScript Developer based out of LA. Originally a graphic designer for around 10 years, I transitioned into web development and have been making websites for the past {yrsExp} years.</p>

I work in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Though always exploring new technologies, my focus right now has been on React.js, Gatsby, GraphQL, Node, and Express.
