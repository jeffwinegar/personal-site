      <h1>Hey, I&rsquo;m Jeff Winegar.</h1>

      <p>
        I&rsquo;m a Frontend JavaScript Developer based out of Los Angeles.
        Originally a graphic designer for 10 years, I transitioned into web
        development and have been building websites for the past 10 years. When
        not writing code I am also an avid bike commuter; a photographer; and a
        maker. I also really enjoy music and watching a good movie.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Though always exploring new
        technologies, my focus right now is on React.js, Gatsby, Next.js,
        GraphQL, Node, and Express. Take a look at a few of my public projects:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Project 1</li>
        <li>Project 2</li>
        <li>Project 3</li>
        <li>Project 4</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        I am currently a Senior Web Developer at Wunderman Thompson where I do
        hands-on development and lead teams working for clients including
        Hyundai, Genesis, Shell, Pennzoil, Quaker State, Hulu, CareCredit, SCAN,
        and The University of California, Irvine in projects that span from
        micro-sites, landing pages, and site components to responsive dynamic
        data-driven emails and animated banner ads.
      </p>

      <p>

        GitHub profile. You can also see my work history on LinkedIn, or get in
